# Create mentoring programs

A mentoring program is a timed set of goalposts that help you and your employees find the best approach in upskilling.

Participants of the program can either be a mentor or mentee.

<deflist type="narrow">
<def title="Mentor">A person that shares their knowledge with mentees during the mentoring program.
</def>
<def title="Mentee">A person that is learning the subject matter from the mentor.</def>
</deflist>

## Create program draft

The first step is to create a draft that includes details about the program, such as mentors and mentees, timeline, and relevant competencies.

<procedure title="Create program draft">
<step>Open the Mentoring Programs app and click <control>Create</control>.</step>
<step>Fill in the details:

<deflist type="narrow">
<def title="Program title">Name of the mentoring program. Visible to participants.
</def>
<def title="Objective">Describe the objective, e.g., “Develop leadership skills” or “Prepare for cross-functional roles”.
</def>
<def title="Competencies">Select relevant competencies and their levels from the Competency Center. Required for automatic matching.</def>
<def title="Start date / End date">Schedule the program timeline.</def>
<def title="Matching strategy">Choose how mentors and mentees are matched:
<deflist type="narrow">
<def title="Manual">Assign mentors and mentees manually.
</def>
<def title="Automatic">Assign mentors and mentees based on the selected competencies and potential mentees' <a href="Proficiency-requirements.md">proficiency requirements</a>.</def>
<def title="Self-matching" id="self-matching">Allow mentees to enter the program on their own.</def>
</deflist>
</def>
<def title="Mentor">Assign a mentor manually or via automatic matching.</def>
<def title="Mentees">Assign mentees manually or via automatic matching.</def>
</deflist>
</step>
<step>Click <control>Save draft</control>. Assigned mentors will be notified about the newly created program.</step>
</procedure>

## Add goalposts

Now that initial program draft is complete, the next step is to add goalposts inside the program. 
Usually this is done by mentors, but you can follow the same instruction to add them yourself.

<procedure title="Add goalposts">
<step>Find your mentoring program in the Mentoring Programs app.</step>
<step>In the <icon src="MoreActions.svg"/><control>Actions</control> menu, select <control>Add goalposts</control>.</step>
<step>In the dialog, fill in the following details:  
<deflist type="narrow">  
<def title="Title">The name of the goalpost. Use something descriptive like "First check-in" or "Skill demo: Communication".</def>
<def title="Description">Optionally, describe what is expected or what should happen at this stage of the program.</def>
<def title="Target competency">Select a competency this goalpost supports. This helps track progress during the program.</def>
<def title="Due date">Select when this goalpost should be completed. You can edit it later.
<warning>Only dates inside the program timeline can be selected.</warning></def>
</deflist>
</step>
<step>Click <control>Add</control> to save the goalpost. Repeat the process to add more goalposts.</step>
<step>Click <control>Publish</control> to make the program public. Assigned mentees will be notified of this.</step>
</procedure>
