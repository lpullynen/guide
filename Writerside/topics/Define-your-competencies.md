# Set your own competencies

By default, users cannot change their competencies manually. 

You can allow users to edit or add their personal competencies under the [created framework](Create-competency-framework.md).
They don't need permissions to add personal growth goals.

<note>As Competency Admin or Competency Manager, you can always change your personal competencies.</note>

## Self-review settings

If you want to allow normal users to change their competencies,
you need to enable the corresponding setting.

<procedure title="Enable competency self-review" id="enable_competency_self_review">
<step>Go to <ui-path>Competency Center > Settings</ui-path></step>
<step>Navigate to <control>Permissions</control> section.</step>
<step>In <control>Self-review</control>, select from the dropdown:
<deflist type="narrow">
<def title="All users">Allow all users to define their competencies.</def>
<def title="Select user groups">Select the user groups that you want to have this permission.</def>
</deflist>
</step>
<step>Click <control>Save</control> to confirm your changes.</step>
</procedure>

## Edit your competencies

If allowed by the settings, users can add new competencies and edit existing ones. 

<procedure title="Edit your competencies">
<step>Go to <ui-path>Competency Center > My competencies</ui-path>.</step>
<step>Find the competency you want to edit and click on it to open the proficiency level scale. 
</step>
<step>Select the proficiency level on the scale.
<note>If there are any <a href="Proficiency-requirements.md">proficiency requirements</a>, an extra scale will show them underneath.</note></step>
<step>Click <control>Confirm</control> to add the competency to your personal profile.</step>
</procedure>

## Set growth goals

<procedure title="Set growth goals" id="set_growth_goals">
<step>Go to <ui-path>Competency Center > My competencies</ui-path>.</step>
<step>Find the competency you want to edit and click on it to open the proficiency level scale. 
</step>
<step>Click <icon src="Star.svg"/> <control>Add growth goal</control> next to its name.</step>
