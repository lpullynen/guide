# Set user competencies

As a Competency Manager, you can manually add and edit competencies for other users through the Competency Center.

<procedure title="Set competencies for a single user" id="set_competency_for_a_single_user">
<step>Go to <ui-path>Competency Center > Users</ui-path> and find the user.</step>
<step>Click on the username and find the competency you want to add or edit.</step>
<step>On the proficiency level scale, select the level to apply it.</step>
<step>Click <control>Save</control>.</step>
</procedure>

If you have many people with the same competency level, you can fill them in bulk.
<procedure title="Set competencies for multiple users">
<step>Go to <ui-path>Competency Center > Users</ui-path> and select each user using the checkboxes.</step>
<step>Click <control>Edit competencies in bulk</control> and find the competency you want to edit.
<note>This opens the shared framework, where you can view how many of the selected users are at each proficiency level for each competency.</note>
</step>
<step>On the proficiency level scale, select the level to apply it. 
<tip>A validation dialog will appear, if there are users with a higher proficiency level. Click <control>Edit anyway</control> to proceed or <control>Exclude user</control> to remove them from selection.</tip>
</step>
<step>Click <control>Save</control>.</step>
