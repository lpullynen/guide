# ForgeLight 2.0

This update introduces new features and improvements to help you manage skills and mentoring more efficiently. 

## Import competencies from JSON

Instead of manually creating the competency framework, you can now [import them from JSON](Import-competencies.md), along with the categories and proficiency levels.

These will not replace existing items and provide validation errors if there any conflicts.

<note>You can download a <resource src="import_sample.json">sample JSON file</resource> to serve as a basis.
It includes some examples of levels, competencies, and categories.</note>

## Set proficiency requirements

In the Competency Center, you can now set [proficiency requirements](Proficiency-requirements.md) for certain user groups.
Every user in that group will see this requirement in their competencies. 

As Competency Manager, you will also see every user's requirements when browsing the framework. 

This helps you align your professional development efforts and maximize the upskilling efficiency.

## Create mentoring programs

The mentoring programs that suit your <a href="Define-your-competencies.md#set-growth-goals">growth goals</a> are now marked with <icon src="Star.svg"/> star icon.
