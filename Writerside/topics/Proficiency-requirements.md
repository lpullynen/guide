You can set proficiency level requirements for specific user groups.
This is essential to identify growth areas, which is the difference between the current proficiency level and requirement.

These requirements will be displayed to each user in their competencies, letting them know the level they need to be at.
As Competency Admin or Competency Manager, you will also see these requirements, when browsing user competencies.
